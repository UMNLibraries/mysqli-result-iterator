# mysqli-result-iterator

A PHP package that wraps the Iterator API around the Mysqli result-fetching API.

## Installing

Install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). In your project's `composer.json`:

```json
  "require": {
    "umnlib/mysqli-result-iterator": ">=1.0.0"
  },
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "git@github.umn.edu:Libraries/mysqli-result-iterator.git"
    }
  ]
```

## No Tests!

There are no tests for this package. If we are actually using this package such that we require tests,
we should probably upgrade it to use PDO instead first.

## Older Versions

For older versions of this package that did not use Composer, see the `0.x.y` releases.
